        <p>Nasi goreng is a Southeast Asian fried rice dish, usually cooked with pieces of meat and vegetables. </p>
        <p>Nasi goreng is distinguished from other Asian fried rice preparations by its distinct smoky aroma, and caramelised yet savoury undertones of flavour. There is no single defined recipe for nasi goreng, and its composition and preparation varies greatly from household to household.</p>
